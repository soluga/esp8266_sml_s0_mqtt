# esp8266_sml_s0_mqtt
ESP-Script for reading SML (incl. CRC-Check) from a digital energy counter, counting S0 (impulses) and sending the data via MQTT.

This is a basic INO script. It's not beauty and contains lot of debugging code.
It's ment for your reference if you plan to implement something like me.

Pull requests greatly appreciated. :)
